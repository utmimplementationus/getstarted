## US UTM Implementation \- Prioritization Implementation

## **Operations Committee Policy for Prioritization of UAS operations with UAS Traffic management (UTM)**

### 

In 2024, at the request of the FAA and in furtherance of shared airspace concepts, the governance committees began efforts to support operational prioritization as part of the implementation of F3548-21.  These efforts would support a community-based approach to prioritizing certain operations, particularly providing public safety operators a level of assurance that their missions would not be blocked by conflicts from commercial operators. A task force comprising participants from FAA, NASA and industry stakeholders validated operational assumptions and desired outcomes.  The task force [recommended an initial implementation of two prioritization levels](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rUFNDdZOrlWkD4siwZfOQdORLPOKJdWnyGc--a5XLdk/edit?slide=id.g321147a6f9c_0_0#slide=id.g321147a6f9c_0_0) based on initial operational needs and data collection metrics to validate operational effectiveness. 

During the task force deliberations, the FAA shared a more complex prioritization scheme than the task force ultimately recommended.  As a matter of public policy, the FAA intends to share this recommendation through public comment (this is expected in the upcoming Normalizing UAS BVLOS Operations Notice of Proposed Rulemaking). 

The governance committees have decided to support the task force’s recommendation of two initial operational priority levels that correspond to the most common use cases seen by operators using UTM today. Based on emerging operational needs and forthcoming regulations, this policy and associated implementation materials can be updated on an as needed basis.

This policy describes:  
1\) key differentiators in operational priority levels;   
2\) anticipated USP behaviors in relation to differing operational priority levels;  
3\) the criteria the Operations Committee will use to assess operators seeking to certain priority levels;   
4\) data that is to be collected in relation to operational priority; and  
5\) the process for changing this policy.

## **Differences in Operational Priority Levels**

High priority is reserved for time-critical operations where immediate response is essential for human safety, including the transport of vital medical materials, direct support for public safety emergencies such as fires or accidents, and search and rescue missions. This includes drone-as-first-responder (DFR) missions, but does not include routine training missions conducted by public safety operators.

All other routine operations that do not meet these life-dependent criteria, such as standard package deliveries, infrastructure inspections, and general photography or data collection, are classified as standard priority.

## **USP Behaviors for Operational Priority Conflicts**

The technical committee will revise the Service Description Document (SDD) and other applicable materials, based on the requirements in ASTM F3548-21 to enable high priority operations. 

USPs will notify operators in the Activated state in the event of an overlap involving a high priority operation per ASTM F3548-21 requirements. Operators and USPs are not expected to execute inflight replanning. Consistent with F3548-21 requirements, for all priority levels, equal-priority conflicts are not permitted.

## **Criteria for Operators Seeking to Use High Priority**

Operators intending to use high priority will submit an issue ticket to the Operations Committee. The operator will include one of the following artifacts to substantiate its eligibility for use of high priority:

1) Cover page of Special Governmental Interest (SGI) waiver or COA  
2) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA)  
3) Certificate of Waiver (COW) for Drone-as-First-Responder (DFR) operations 

Operators intending to use high priority for the transport of vital medical materials will submit both of the following:

1) A signed document on the letterhead of a public entity, health system, etc., that sets out the drone operator has been engaged to conduct drone operations on their behalf that involve time-critical operations where immediate response is essential for human safety (In the health context this could be hospitals; federal, state, and local health orgs; labs; public health entities; health-focused non-profits; etc.); and  
2) A signed document from the operator attesting they have all of the authorizations and approvals required to perform the intended operations as of the document’s date.

An operator that does not have any of the above documents may propose an alternative artifact with a supporting rationale (including the expected operational need for high priority), which will be reviewed by the Operations Committee.

Once an Issue Ticket is reviewed and accepted by the Operations Committee, the operator may use high priority for all applicable missions. 

## **Operational Priority Data Collection**

The Technical Committee will update the monthly reporting template to support data collection for prioritization based on metrics recommended by the Prioritization Task Force.

## **Changes to this Policy**

Any affected stakeholder may use the process defined in Annex C, Section 7(h), Issue Resolution, to request a change to this policy, including introduction of new priority levels, or changes to the allowable uses or criteria for existing priority levels. 

## **Further Notes on Implementation**

There is no criteria in Annex C to reassess operational practicality due to the introduction or use of high priority. Initial assessment of airspace efficiency impacts is expected to be via monthly data reporting from USPs/Operators. At the discretion of affected operators, new operational practicality simulations may be conducted, but this is not required in order to use high priority during actual operations.

Once an artifact is reviewed and accepted, the operator is approved to use high priority for all applicable missions without further action. The ongoing impact of these priority flights on airspace efficiency is monitored through monthly data reports, not by re-assessing each flight. The FAA will also have oversight processes that can assess the validity of declared high-priority flights.
