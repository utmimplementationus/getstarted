### What is the US UTM Implementation?

UAS Traffic Management (UTM) implementation in the US is the operationalization of UTM services to support complex UAS operations, with an initial focus on furthering shared airspace.

Shared airspace is the digital coordination of intended UA flight paths with overlapping operators in support of FAA Order 8040.6A and complex operations. This implementation of shared airspace leverages the strategic conflict detection and aggregated conformance monitoring services (collectively identified as strategic coordination) defined in [ASTM F3548-21 Standard Specification for UAS Traffic Management (UTM) UAS Service Supplier (USS) Interoperability](https://www.astm.org/f3548-21.html). These services are expected to be accepted by the FAA per the [Near Term Approvals Process (NTAP)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/advanced_operations/traffic_management), or via other means such as an FAA Letter of Acceptance, and incorporate participation and feedback from the FAA and NASA. Participants include Service Providers and Operators with the need to reduce UA to UA risk and who have signed the agreement available on the Get Started page.

### Why should I join the US UTM Implementation?

The US UTM Implementation was driven by operational demand. As complex drone operations proliferate, UAS operators are solving cooperative airspace needs through data sharing practices and the use of the [ASTM F3548-21 Standard Specification for UAS Traffic Management (UTM) UAS Service Supplier (USS) Interoperability](https://www.astm.org/f3548-21.html).
UAS Operators and UTM Service Providers who have a need to share airspace with other complex drone operations as required by [FAA Order 8040.6A](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1042092) can join the US UTM Implementation.

### Am I ready to join the US UTM Implementation?	

To join the US UTM Implementation, participants must be ready to pass Gate 1 criteria and sign the governance agreement as provided on the Get Started page.

### What is covered in the governance agreement?	

Digital coordination of flight intent requires the exchange of data among service providers. The agreement governs three main topics 1) what data can be exchanged and how it can be used, 2) how others can join the agreement, and 3) how to address situations when companies are not performing as expected.

### Is this implementation regionally limited?	

No. While stemming from the operational and commercial need for shared airspace currently seen in the busy North Texas drone services market, this agreement can be operationalized anywhere in the US, provided the parties involved have the appropriate permissions and need to do so.

### How does it relate to the UTM Key Site? 	

For information about the FAAâ€™s UTM Key Site Operational Evaluation, [see here](https://www.faa.gov/uas/research_development/traffic_management/UTM-Key-Site-Ops-Eval-Workshop.pdf).

### How do I sign the governance agreement?	

[Send an email to the Operations Committee](mailto:operations-committee+owner@utm-implementation-us.groups.io) when you are ready to sign.

### How do I show that I passed Gate 1 criteria?	

If you have already passed Gate 1, please upload your single-operator test report when you submit your operator participation interest form. Otherwise, attach the test report [in an email to the Operations Committee](mailto:operations-committee+owner@utm-implementation-us.groups.io).

### I'm interested in providing other services besides strategic coordination. Can I still join the US UTM implemenation?	

At this time, the US UTM Implementation is focused on standing up core strategic coordination services to manage UA-UA collision risk. As the technical roadmap matures, other interoperable service options may also be managed through the US UTM Implementation committees. If you offer SDSP capabilities, you may pursue partnerships directly with operators or other service providers (subject to applicable regulatory approval), but you do not need to formally join the US UTM Implementation.

### I'd like to join the committee meetings and/or read the minutes of past committee meetings. How can I get access?	

The Operations Committee and Technical Committee meetings, along with their minutes, are open to any stakeholders who have signed the governance agreement and passed the Gate 1 criteria. Government officials (other than FAA) who have questions about committee proceedings should contact the [Operations Committee](mailto:operations-committee+owner@utm-implementation-us.groups.io), and/or the [Technical Committee](mailto:technical-committee+owner@utm-implementation-us.groups.io), with specific requests.

### How is this inititiave funded?	

Operators, service providers and other stakeholders are expected to cover their own costs of participation. 

### Are there any fees for joining the UTM Implementation cohort?	

No, joining the US UTM Implementation is free of charge. However, according to the data sharing and governance agreement, members must cover all of their expenses.
