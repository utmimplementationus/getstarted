## Onboarding Process for the US UTM Implementation

Welcome to the US UTM Implementation! Below is a detailed guide to help new participants navigate the onboarding process. Please carefully review the guide and associated timelines to determine your readiness to start the process.

### 1. Sign the Governance Agreement

To become a participant, the first step is to sign the Governance Agreement Form of Joinder (Annex E). Please provide the email address and name of the point of contact (POC) responsible for signing this document to operations-committee+owner@utm-implementation-us.groups.io. The document will then be sent to you for signature via DocuSign.

After signing Annex E, please email the names and contact information, including GitHub handles, for your:
+ Operations Committee POC
+ Technical Committee POC
+ Accountable Executive
Send this information to operations-committee+owner@utm-implementation-us.groups.io. Note that the POCs and/or Accountable Executive can be the same person or different individuals within your organization. This is a mandatory prerequisite for all applicants.

### 2. Automated Testing Onboarding

Upon signing the governance agreement, applicants will have a 60-calendar-day period to complete their official automated testing onboarding (Gates 1 through 3 as defined in Annex B). A test configuration will be provided, enabling applicants to conduct tests independently without affecting existing participants.

### 3. Observer Status

The applicant's chosen representatives will be granted observer status in both the Operations Committee and the Technical Committee during the onboarding period, as soon as the governance agreement Form of Joinder is received and processed. This status allows them to stay informed about the initiativeâ€™s activities and developments. Observers have limited voting privileges, as detailed in the governance agreement.

### 4. Completion and Compliance

USS applicants must complete all automated testing (Gates 1 through 3) and secure a signed agreement with an operator within the 60-calendar-day period. Failure to meet these requirements will result in the applicant being removed from the US UTM Implementation and the loss of observer access to the committees. Prior to the end of the 60-day period, applicants may request a one-time extension of up to 30 additional days from the Operations Committee.

### 5. Reapplication Process

If removed from the project, applicants may reapply after a waiting period of 90 calendar days from the date of removal.

We are excited to have you join us in advancing the US UTM Implementation. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a successful onboarding experience.
